# Feign makes writing Java http clients easier

https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign

Feign is a Java to HTTP client binder inspired by [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit), [JAXRS-2.0](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/nonav/2.0/apidocs/index.html), and [WebSocket](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jsr356-1937161.html). Feign's first goal was reducing the complexity of binding [Denominator](https://github.com/Netflix/Denominator) uniformly to HTTP APIs regardless of [ReSTfulness](http://www.slideshare.net/adrianfcole/99problems).
